Child theme of [Dyad](https://wordpress.org/themes/dyad/) by Automattic (they make [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.com))

# Why?

Adding additional functionality to a child theme is better than modifying a 3rd party theme. 

## Changes

Some (but not all) changes include:

* Added menu location to the header for social media.
